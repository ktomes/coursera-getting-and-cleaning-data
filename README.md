coursera-getting-and-cleaning-data
==================================

A repo for the project for 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course from Johns Hopkins University, via Coursera

run_analysis.R

The run_analysis script: 
•	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
•	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
•	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
•	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
•	Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This is the course project / peer assessment associated the Coursera MOOC "Getting and Cleaning Data". This R script, 
run_analysis.R, takes data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone that contains the 
mean of the variables that relate to mean and std dev for each activity and each subject.
